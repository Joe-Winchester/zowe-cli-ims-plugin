 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe ims stop region [options]

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --region-ids  (array)

      specify either this option or --job-name.

   --job-name  (string)

      The name of the job for the IMS region you want to stop. You must specify either
      this option or --region-ids.

   --abdump  (string)

      Specify this option to cause abnormal termination of an application program. If
      the transaction indicated by this argument is currently running in the specified
      region, an error message is received at the master terminal, indicating an
      application program abend. The region will remain active, but the transaction
      will be stopped. The command is ignored if the transaction is not currently
      scheduled in the region.

   --cancel  (boolean)

      Use this option if the region cannot be stopped with a stop region --abdump
      command. To use this option, you must have already submitted a stop region
      command using the --abdump option.

 IMS CONNECTION OPTIONS

   --host  | -H (string)

      The IMS Command Services server host name.

   --port  | -P (number)

      The IMS Command Services server port.

   --ims-connect-host  | --ich (string)

      the mainframe LPAR where IMS Connect is running.

   --ims-connect-port  | --icp (number)

      The port of your instance of IMS Connect. This port can be found in your IMS
      Connect configuration file on the mainframe.

   --plex  | -x (string)

      The name of the IMS plex.

   --user  | -u (string)

      Mainframe (IMS) user name, which can be the same as your TSO login.

   --ims-profile  | --ims-p (string)

 RESPONSE FORMAT OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --response-format-filter  | --rff (array)

      names to include in the output response. You can filter JSON objects properties
      OR table columns/fields. In addition, you can use this option in conjunction

   --response-format-type  | --rft (string)

      The command response output format type. Must be one of the following:

      table: Formats output data as a table. Use this option when the output data is
      an array of homogeneous JSON objects. Each property of the object will become a
      column in the table.

      list: Formats output data as a list of strings. Can be used on any data type
      (JSON objects/arrays) are stringified and a new line is added after each entry
      in an array.

      object: Formats output data as a list of prettified objects (or single object).
      Can be used in place of \\"table\\" to change from tabular output to a list of
      prettified objects.

      string: Formats output data as a string. JSON objects/arrays are stringified.

      Allowed values: table, list, object, string

   --response-format-header  | --rfh (boolean)

      If \\"--response-format-type table\\" is specified, include the column headers in
      the output.

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --response-format-json  | --rfj (boolean)

      Produce JSON formatted data from a command

   --help  | -h (boolean)

      Display help text
