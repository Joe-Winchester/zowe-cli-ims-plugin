      The command response output format type. Must be one of the following:

      table: Formats output data as a table. Use this option when the output data is
      an array of homogeneous JSON objects. Each property of the object will become a
      column in the table.

      list: Formats output data as a list of strings. Can be used on any data type
      (JSON objects/arrays) are stringified and a new line is added after each entry
      in an array.

      object: Formats output data as a list of prettified objects (or single object).
      Can be used in place of \\"table\\" to change from tabular output to a list of
      prettified objects.

      string: Formats output data as a string. JSON objects/arrays are stringified.

      Allowed values: table, list, object, string

   --response-format-json  | --rfj (boolean)

      Produce JSON formatted data from a command

   --help  | -h (boolean)

      Display help text


 EXAMPLES

   - Stop an application program named PGM123:

      $ bright ims stop program PGM123

   - Stop all application programs beginning with ACC*:

      $ bright ims stop program ACC*

   - Stop tracing an application program named PGM234:

      $ bright ims stop program PGM234 --attributes TRACE

   - Stop an application program named PGM890 routing to control
   regions IMS1 and IMS2:

      $ bright ims stop program PGM890 --route IMS1 IMS2

   - Stop an application programs named XYZ1 specifying optional
   connection parameters:

      $ bright ims stop program XYZ1 --host localhost --port 8080 --ich zos1 --icp 9999 --plex PLEX1
