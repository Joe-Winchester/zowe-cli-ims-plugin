      Connect configuration file on the mainframe.

   --plex  | -x (string)

      The name of the IMS plex.

 RESPONSE FORMAT OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --response-format-filter  | --rff (array)

      names to include in the output response. You can filter JSON objects properties
      OR table columns/fields. In addition, you can use this option in conjunction
      with '--response-format-type' to reduce the output of a command to a single
      field/property or a list of a single field/property.

   --response-format-type  | --rft (string)

      The command response output format type. Must be one of the following:

      table: Formats output data as a table. Use this option when the output data is
      an array of homogeneous JSON objects. Each property of the object will become a
      column in the table.

      list: Formats output data as a list of strings. Can be used on any data type
      (JSON objects/arrays) are stringified and a new line is added after each entry
      in an array.

      object: Formats output data as a list of prettified objects (or single object).
      Can be used in place of \\"table\\" to change from tabular output to a list of
      prettified objects.

      string: Formats output data as a string. JSON objects/arrays are stringified.

      Allowed values: table, list, object, string

   --response-format-header  | --rfh (boolean)

      If \\"--response-format-type table\\" is specified, include the column headers in
      the output.

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --response-format-json  | --rfj (boolean)

      Produce JSON formatted data from a command

   --help  | -h (boolean)

      Display help text


 EXAMPLES
 --------

   - Start an application program named PGM123:

      $ zowe ims start program PGM123

   - Start all application programs beginning with ACC*:

      $ zowe ims start program ACC*

   - Start an application program named PGM234 and start
   tracing:

      $ zowe ims start program PGM234 --attributes SCHD TRACE

   - Start an application program named PGM890 routing to
   control regions IMS1 and IMS2:

      $ zowe ims start program PGM890 --route IMS1 IMS2

   - Start an application programs named XYZ1 specifying
   optional connection parameters:

      $ zowe ims start program XYZ1 --host localhost --port 8080 --ich zos1 --icp 9999 --plex PLEX1
