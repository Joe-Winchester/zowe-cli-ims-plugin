# Zowe CLI Plug-in for IBM速 IMS速 
The Zowe CLI Plug-in for IBM速 IMS速 lets you extend Zowe CLI to interact with IBM IMS programs and transactions. The plug-in uses the IBM IMS Management Client Interface (CMCI) API to achieve the interaction with IMS. For more information, see [IMS management client interface](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSGMCP_5.3.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.clientapi.doc/topics/clientapi_overview.html) on the IBM Knowledge Center.

As an application developer, you can use the plug-in to perform various IMS-related tasks, such as the following:

* Deploy code changes to IMS applications that were developed with COBOL.
* Deploy changes to IMS regions for testing or delivery.
* Automate IMS interaction steps in your CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins Automation Server or TravisCI.

## Contribution Guidelines

For more information about general development guidelines and IMS plug-in specific information, see [the Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Tip:** Follow the [tutorials on the documentation site](https://zowe.github.io/docs-site/latest/extend/extend-cli/cli-devTutorials.html) to start developing your first plug-in! 

## Prerequisites
Before you install the plug-in, meet the following prerequisites:
* Install Zowe CLI on your PC.

    **Note:** For more information, see [Installing Zowe CLI](https://zowe.github.io/docs-site/latest/user-guide/cli-installcli.html).

* Ensure that [IBM IMS Transaction Server v5.2](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSGMCP_5.2.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.home.doc/welcomePage/welcomePage.html) or later is installed and running in your mainframe environment.

 * Ensure that [IBM IMS Management Client Interface (CMCI)](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSGMCP_5.2.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.clientapi.doc/topics/clientapi_overview.html) is configured and running in your IMS region. 

## Build the Plug-in from Source
**Follow these steps:**

1. The first time that you download the Zowe CLI plug-in for IMS from the GitHub repository, issue the following command against the local directory:

    ```
    npm install
    ```
    The command installs the required Zowe CLI Plug-in for IMS dependencies and several development tools. When necessary, you can run the task at any time to update the tools.

2. To build your code changes, issue the following command:

    ```
    npm run build
    ```

    The first time you build your code changes, you will be prompted for the location of the Imperative CLI Framework package, which is located in the `node_modules/@brightside` folder in the directory where Zowe CLI was installed.

    **Note:** When you update `package.json` to include new dependencies, or when you pull changes that affect `package.json`, issue the `npm update` command to download the dependencies.

## Install the Zowe CLI Plug-in for IMS

**Follow these steps:**

1.  Meet the prerequisites.
2.  Install the plug-in:
    ```
    zowe plugins install @brightside/cics
    ``` 
3.  (Optional) Verify the installation:
    ```
    zowe plugins validate @brightside/cics
    ```
    When you install the plug-in successfully, the following message displays:
    ```
    Validation results for plugin 'cics':
    Successfully validated.
    ``` 
    **Tip:** When an unsuccessful message displays, you can troubleshoot the installation by addressing the issues that the message describes. You can also review the information that is contained in the log file that is located in the directory where you installed Zowe CLI.  

4.  [Create a user profile](#create-a-user-profile).

## Create a User Profile
You can create a `cics` user profile to avoid typing your connection details on every command. A `cics` profile contains the host, port, username, and password for the IBM CMCI server of your choice. You can create multiple profiles and switch between them as needed.

**Follow these steps:**
1.  Create a IMS profile: 
    ```
    zowe profiles create cics <profile name> <host> <port> <user> <password>
    ```
    The result of the command displays as a success or failure message. You can use your profile when you issue commands in the cics command group.

**Tip:** For more information about the syntax, actions, and options, for a profiles create command, open Zowe CLI and issue the following command:

```
zowe profiles create cics -h
```

## Run Tests

For information about running automated, unit, and system and integration tests using the plug-in, see [Zowe CLI Plug-in Testing Guidelines](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/blob/master/docs/PluginTESTINGGuidelines.md).

## Uninstall the Plug-in

**Follow these steps:**
1.  To uninstall the plug-in from a base application, issue the following command:
    ```
    zowe plugins uninstall @brightside/cics
    ```
After the uninstallation process completes successfully, the product no longer contains the plug-in configuration.
